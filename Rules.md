# Set up

1. Separate the bonds, and each group of share certificates. Separate the 'Reserved' EBR certificates from the other EBR certificates.

2. Place the EBR, L&W and TMLC certificate on their respective charters.

3. Place the red 'Independent" certificates in order with the numbers on the card, with '1' ('Grubb's Tramway') on top. 

4. Place the bonds next to the board.

5. Shuffle the setup cards. Shuffle the independent stations. For each tile on the map with a 'setup' symbol, draw a setup card. The setup card shows what to place in the spaces around the setup symbol. Ensure to maintain the same orientation as the setup symbol. If there is a red circle on the setup card, place a random independent station in that space. Place the number of black cubes indicated in any spaces where there are black squares. Neighboring setup cards may add cubes to the same space as cubes or even independent tokens.

6. Place the number of matching colored cubes indicated on each charter on that charter. Place one additional cube for each of EBR, L&W and TMLC near the revenue tracker. Place one Independent track cube on Grubb's Tramway.

7. Place additional cubes in the spaces marked on the action table.

8. Split ₤20 (or ₤18 for 3 players) evenly between the players.

# Game play

## Initial Auction

Initial Shares are auctioned off in the following order: L&W, TMLC, EBR, Grubb's Tramway. Use the same rules as the 'Auction Share' action. Randomly pick a player to be the first bidder for L&W. For each subsequent auction, the first bidder is the winner of the previous auction. If no player bids for the share, the first bidder gets the share for free. This includes Grubb's Tramway which would usually need a minimum bid to pay for its station, which it gets for free.

The winner of Grubb's Tramway gets the track cube on the card, and is the first player.

## Sequence of play

On your turn, you must select one of the actions, and then do it. After your action, if the game is not over, the next player is the player on your left.

You choose an action by picking up a cube from a space in the action table, and placing it in a different available space on a different action. If all the spaces in an action are full, you can not do that action. If you are not able to do an action, you can not pick that action.

## Actions

### Build Track

You can take the build track action if you have at least one share in a company you want to place track for, if it has at least one track, and if it has sufficient cash to legally place the track.

To place a track, you place one of the cubes (track) from the company's charter in a valid spot adjacent to the company's station or existing track. You then pay the bank from the company's money the cost of the track. You do not, and can not, pay your own money. Finally, you adjust the revenue on the revenue tracker for the company.

The cost of placing a track on each type of hex is shown in the cost table on the board, firstly unoccupied, and then occupied by another companies track or station.

Forested (green) and mountainous (green with a triangle) hexes can only be occupied by one company. A company can not have more than one track in the same hex. The Independents' stations occupy their respective spaces from the start of the game.

Independent companies share track. If you can trace adjacent track to a company's station, it counts as 'existing track'. Once an independent is merged, any track that it counted as 'existing track' is now also 'existing track' for the company it merged with.

Grubb's Tramway comes with one free cube to place. When Grubb's Tramway (or its purchaser) builds track, it may use that cube and not pay for the new track.

#### Revenue

If the company is connected to a city, and connecting to any plain hex, increase revenue by ₤1.

If the company is connected to a city, and connecting to a second city, increase revenue by ₤2. If it is connecting to a third city, increase revenue by a further ₤6.

If the company has any resource cubes on its charter, and the company is connecting to its first port, increase revenue by ₤2 for each cube.

### Auction Share

You can auction a share if you can pay the minimum bid, and it has at least one share available.

The player who took the action is the first bidder, and must bid at least the minimum bid. Bidding proceeds to the left. You may bid or pass. Once you have passed, you cannot reenter the auction. Bidding continues until only one player has not passed.

The winner of the auction pays the amount that they bid from their personal cash on the company's charter, and gets a share certificate for the company.

Minimum bid for EBR, L&W or TMLC is its current revenue, minus its per dividend debt obligations, divided by the amount of shares owned by players including the one being sold, which is always rounded up to the next ₤. Minimum bid for the independents is the station price, shown on the card.

The minimum bid must always be at least ₤1.

Only the independent on top of the stack of independents is available. If an independent is auctioned, the station price is payed by the independent immediately after the auction.

### Take Resources

You can take resources if you have at least one share in a company you want to take resources for, and that company has at least one resource cube in a hex it occupies.

You pick the resource cube up, and place it on your companies charter. If you are connected to a port, increase your revenue by ₤3, otherwise, increase your revenue by ₤1.

### Issue Bond

You can issue a bond if you have at least one share in a company you want to issue a bond for, and there is at least one bond available.

Pick up a bond, and place it on your company's charter. Add the amount of money shown on the bond from the bank to the company's charter. Move your company's revenue down as manyt 

The independent companies can not issue bonds.

### Merge Independent

You can merge an independent if the independent has a track or station directly adjacent to the non-independent company you want to merge with, you have at least one share in either of the companies, and that company has at least one unsold share remaining (or reserved, for EBR).

Merge with a company by putting the independent's resource cubes, free track cubes (if any), cash, and share certificates on the other company charter. Add the independent's revenue to the company's revenue on the revenue tracker. If the independent was not formerly connected to a port, and the company it is merging with is, increase revenue by an additional ₤2 for each resource cube that the independent held.

If the company being merged with is EBR, take one of EBRs reserved shares. If it is another company, take one of that company's shares, and move one of EBRs reserved shares to be with the ordinary shares, available for auction.

### Pay dividends

You can pay dividends whenever the action is available.

Each player gets, for each share held, its current revenue, minus its per dividend debt obligations, divided by the amount of shares owned by players rounded up, for each individual share.

Following the dividend round, check whether any of the end-game conditions apply. If they do, place a cube on the relevant space on the board.

If the dividend debt obligations exceed revenue, the company's treasury makes up the shortfall. If there is insufficient cash, then the amount left owing is divided by the amount of shares in that company, rounded up. Each player must pay the bank that amount for each of their shares held. If any player has insufficient cash, then they are bankrupted. Pay all their money to the bank, reduce the debt by the amount of money that they had, regard their shares as no longer held, and repeat this procedure if there are remaining shareholders.

## Ending the game

The game ends in one of 3 ways:

1. If two of the following conditions are true following a Pay Dividends action, the game ends immediately:

 - All company shares (excluding any remaining 'reserved' shares) have been sold to players
 - There are no remaining resource cubes on the board
 - 3 of the 4 charters (including the Independents charter) have no remaining trains
 - There are no remaining bond cards

2. A player goes bankrupt during a Pay Dividends action due to not being able to pay their companies debt obligations. End the game immediately once all dividend payouts are exhausted.

3. There is a stalemate due to a player being unable to perform any actions. Pay dividends, and end the game.

In all cases, the winner is the player with the most money. Ties are possible.
